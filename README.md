## Publication 
Joseph S. Botros, Lamis F. Al-Qora'n, Amro Al-Said Ahmad, Towards antifragility of cloud systems: An adaptive chaos driven framework, Information and Software Technology, Volume 174, 2024, 107519, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2024.107519.

### The Work
The paper proposes UNFRAGILE framework, which facilitates the transformation of existing systems into becoming "antifragile systems". The framework employs chaos engineering to introduce failures incrementally and assess the system's response under such perturbation and improves the quality of system response by removing fragilities and introducing adaptive fault tolerance strategies. Furthermore, the work highlights that chaos engineering can be employed to enhance the performance of software systems, and this new publication demonstrates that it can be integrated with adaptivity tools to transform systems to become stronger under stressors. 

### Results
The results in Fig. 2 show that the framework has defined an overall architecture of supportive modules to help move existing systems from the fragile phase to the antifragile phase through continuous experimentation utilising chaos engineering and monitoring application response to stress.
